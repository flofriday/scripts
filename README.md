# scripts

A simple collection of my private scripts.

## Scipts

### imgmerge

Merge multiple images into one.

### redact

Redact names from textfiles.

### todo-automator

Import tasks into todoist.

### mkurl

Create .url files.

### logouter

Logs me out of social media websites by deleting their cookies.

### sourcepaper

A simple script that packs sourcecode files into a pdf so it can be printed.

## Install scripts globally

**NOTE:** At the moment this only installs `mkurl` and `sourcepaper` globally.

```bash
python3 -m pip install setuptools
python3 -m pip install -e .
```
