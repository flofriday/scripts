# logouter

This script connects to the Firefox database that stores the cookies and deletes
the cookies to many time sinks like youtube, netflix, reddit etc.

Therefore it becomes less convinient to use them as I would need to login in
every time.

I think this is the next best thing but, if it doesn't work I need to do some
proxy blocking or something.

**NOTE:** Firefox must be closed to run this script because otherwise the
database will be locked.

## Usage

```bash
python3 main.py
```
